description: Settings locations, precedence, CLI and environment overrides, and the full Builder config reference.
---

## Precedence

Builder resolves settings in this order (higher no. = higher priority):

1. Built-in defaults
2. `~/.builder/config.toml`
3. `<workspace-root>/.builder/config.toml`
4. Environment variables
5. `builder run` CLI flags

Interactive session flows resolve workspace-local config from the session workspace root. `builder serve` starts without a workspace root and applies workspace config only when a project/session selects a workspace. `builder run` is the only entrypoint that accepts config override flags.

## Locations

### Persistence root

Global settings live at:

```text
~/.builder/config.toml
```

Workspace settings live at:

```text
<workspace-root>/.builder/config.toml
```

Builder also installs a user-editable ripgrep config at:

```text
~/.builder/rg.conf
```

Builder creates `~/.builder/rg.conf` when missing and exports it to shell tools via `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` only when you have not already set `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` yourself.

Changing `persistence_root` does not move either config file. `persistence_root` controls where Builder stores its database & auth state. The default is `~/.builder`.


## Example

```toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
thinking_level = "medium" # low, medium, high, xhigh
model_verbosity = "medium" # or "low"
# system_prompt_file = "SYSTEM.md" # relative to this config.toml directory
theme = "auto" # or light / dark
web_search = "native"
compaction_mode = "local" # or "native" (if supported)
cache_warning_mode = "default" # cache invalidation messages; or "verbose" / "off"
server_host = "127.0.0.1" # builder local server config
server_port = 53082

[timeouts]
model_request_seconds = 400

[tools]
shell = true
# Leave both patch/edit commented to use Builder's model-based default.
# patch = true
# edit = false
view_image = true
web_search = true
trigger_handoff = true # proactive compaction by the model

[shell]
postprocessing_mode = "all" # shell output token optimizations by Builder, or "all" | "none" | "user"
# postprocess_hook = "~/.builder/shell_postprocess_hook" # custom postprocess_hook, see docs

[skills]
"skill name" = true

[reviewer] # aka supervisor
frequency = "edits"
timeout_seconds = 60
verbose_output = false # show in ongoing transcript
# system_prompt_file = "~/.builder/reviewer_system_prompt.md"

# custom subagent roles config, fast is the default one, always provided
[subagents.fast]
# model = "gpt-5.4-mini"
# priority_request_mode = true
```

## CLI Overrides

| Flag | Overrides | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `builder run --model` | `model` | |
| `builder run --provider-override` | `provider_override` | |
| `builder run --thinking-level` | `thinking_level` | |
| `builder run --theme` | `theme` | |
| `builder run --model-timeout-seconds` | `timeouts.model_request_seconds` | |
| `builder run --tools` | entire tool set | CSV replacement, not a merge |
| `builder run --openai-base-url` | `openai_base_url` | Also affects continuation behavior |


`builder run` also accepts the headless-only selectors `--agent <role>` and `--fast`, which choose a subagent role rather than directly overriding one config key.

## Reference

### Core Settings

| Key | Type | Default | Env | CLI | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | string | `gpt-5.5` | `BUILDER_MODEL` | `builder run --model` | Model name. If provider inference from the model name is not enough, set `provider_override` too. |
| `thinking_level` | string | `medium` | `BUILDER_THINKING_LEVEL` | `builder run --thinking-level` | Provider-specific reasoning effort string. |
| `model_verbosity` | string | `medium` |  |  | Text verbosity hint for supported models. Allowed: `""`, `low`, `medium`, `high`. Unsupported models ignore it. |
| `system_prompt_file` | string | `""` |  |  | Main system prompt file. Relative paths resolve from the containing `config.toml` directory. Empty files are skipped. |
| `theme` | string | `auto` | `BUILDER_THEME` | `builder run --theme` | TUI theme. Allowed: `auto`, `light`, `dark`. `light` and `dark` force Builder's fixed palettes. `auto` or an omitted value falls back to terminal background detection. |
| `notification_method` | string | `auto` | `BUILDER_NOTIFICATION_METHOD` |  | Terminal notification backend. Allowed: `auto`, `osc9`, `bel`. `auto` chooses `osc9` on supported terminals and falls back to `bel`. |
| `tool_preambles` | bool | `true` | `BUILDER_TOOL_PREAMBLES` |  | Includes tool-usage preambles in the main system prompt for interactive runs. Headless `builder run` still suppresses them. |
| `priority_request_mode` | bool | `false` |  |  | Enables fast-mode requests where the provider supports them. |
| `debug` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_DEBUG` |  | Enables global developer-oriented strictness and logging. Only use for development/debugging |
| `server_host` | string | `127.0.0.1` | `BUILDER_SERVER_HOST` |  | Exact TCP app-server host Builder will dial or listen on. Builder does not use discovery files or silent port rebinding. Same-machine Unix socket optimization, when supported, is derived automatically and does not override an explicit TCP target. |
| `server_port` | int | `53082` | `BUILDER_SERVER_PORT` |  | Exact TCP app-server port Builder will dial or listen on. Must match across clients attached to the same persistence root. Same-machine Unix socket optimization, when supported, is additive only and does not override an explicit TCP target. |
| `web_search` | string | `native` | `BUILDER_WEB_SEARCH` |  | Web search backend. Allowed: `off`, `native`. `custom` (e.g. Brave Search) is not implemented yet, on the roadmap. |
| `provider_override` | string | `""` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_OVERRIDE` | `builder run --provider-override` | Forces provider family for custom or alias model names. Allowed: `openai`, `anthropic`. Requires an explicit `model` override. |
| `openai_base_url` | string | `""` | `BUILDER_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `builder run --openai-base-url` | OpenAI-compatible base URL. Must be used with `provider_override=openai` or with no explicit provider override. Cannot be changed mid-session. |
| `store` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_STORE` |  | Sets OpenAI Responses `store=true` for main model requests. |
| `allow_non_cwd_edits` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_ALLOW_NON_CWD_EDITS` |  | Lets first-class file edit tools edit files outside the workspace root. This is not sandboxing - model can still bypass this easily. |
| `model_context_window` | int | `272000` | `BUILDER_MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW` |  | Explicit context-window size used for compaction and token accounting. Must be `> 0`. |
| `context_compaction_threshold_tokens` | int | `258400` | `BUILDER_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` |  | Auto-compaction threshold. Must be `> 0`, `< model_context_window`, and at least `50%` of `model_context_window`. The default is derived from the default context window. |
| `pre_submit_compaction_lead_tokens` | int | `35000` | `BUILDER_PRE_SUBMIT_COMPACTION_LEAD_TOKENS` |  | Fixed pre-submit runway reserve before auto-compaction. Builder compacts before sending the next user prompt once (`context_compaction_threshold_tokens` - this threshold) is reached. |
| `minimum_exec_to_bg_seconds` | int | `15` | `BUILDER_MINIMUM_EXEC_TO_BG_SECONDS` |  | Default floor for `exec_command` yield time before it moves to background and lets Builder manage it asynchronously. Must be `> 0`. Use if model frequently expects your commands to complete fast, they background, and force model to poll for them. |
| `compaction_mode` | string | `local` | `BUILDER_COMPACTION_MODE` |  | Allowed: `native`, `local`, `none`. `native` prefers provider-native compaction and falls back to local compaction. `local` always uses local summary compaction. `none` disables auto-compaction and makes manual compaction fail. |
| `cache_warning_mode` | string | `default` | `BUILDER_CACHE_WARNING_MODE` |  | Prompt-cache warning policy. Allowed: `off`, `default`, `verbose`. `default` catches unwanted invalidations and keeps them in detail mode. `verbose` includes everything from `default`, surfaces cache warnings in ongoing mode too, and a broader range of warnings. |
| `shell_output_max_chars` | int | `16000` | `BUILDER_SHELL_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS` |  | Output budget for shell tools and background-shell notices before they are truncated. |
| `bg_shells_output` | string | `default` | `BUILDER_BG_SHELLS_OUTPUT` |  | Background-shell output mode (injection of shell outputs into model context). Allowed: `default`, `verbose`, `concise`. Verbose dumps all output into the main agent's model. Concise forces it to read output files. Default outputs truncated previews + gives a file path. |
| `shell.postprocessing_mode` | string | `builtin` | `BUILDER_SHELL_POSTPROCESSING_MODE` |  | Semantic post-processing mode for `exec_command`. Allowed: `none`, `builtin`, `user`, `all`. `builtin` enables Builder processors only. `all` runs Builder processors first, then your hook. |
| `shell.postprocess_hook` | string | `""` | `BUILDER_SHELL_POSTPROCESS_HOOK` |  | Optional executable/script path for a single local command post-processing hook. Builder sends JSON on stdin and expects JSON on stdout. |
| `persistence_root` | string | `~/.builder` | `BUILDER_PERSISTENCE_ROOT` |  | Root for auth, session, and workspace index storage. Does not change the location of `~/.builder/config.toml`. |

### Timeouts

| Key | Type | Default | Env | CLI | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `timeouts.model_request_seconds` | int | `400` | `BUILDER_TIMEOUTS_MODEL_REQUEST_SECONDS` | `builder run --model-timeout-seconds` | HTTP timeout for model requests. Must be `> 0`. |


### Supervisor
Configure the supervisor agent that oversees model changes.

| Key | Type | Default | Env | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reviewer.frequency` | string | `edits` | `BUILDER_REVIEWER_FREQUENCY` | Allowed: `off`, `all`, `edits`. `all` runs the reviewer after every completed assistant turn. `edits` runs it only after successful first-class file edits. |
| `reviewer.model` | string | inherits `model` | `BUILDER_REVIEWER_MODEL` | Separate model for the reviewer pass. If unset, Builder uses main `model`. |
| `reviewer.thinking_level` | string | inherits `thinking_level` | `BUILDER_REVIEWER_THINKING_LEVEL` | Allowed: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`. |
| `reviewer.system_prompt_file` | string | `""` |  | Path to a custom supervisor system prompt file. Relative paths resolve from the config file directory. Workspace config overrides global config; no CLI or environment override is provided. |
| `reviewer.timeout_seconds` | int | `60` | `BUILDER_REVIEWER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Reviewer HTTP timeout. Must be `> 0`. |
| `reviewer.verbose_output` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_REVIEWER_VERBOSE_OUTPUT` | Controls whether reviewer suggestion text is shown at all. When `false`, Builder only shows the concise reviewer result/status line. When `true`, Builder shows the full suggestion list at the moment the reviewer issues it, and the later reviewer status stays concise after the follow-up is applied or ignored. |

### Model Capability Overrides

Use these only for custom or alias models when the built-in model registry is not enough.

| Key | Type | Default | Env | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model_capabilities.supports_reasoning_effort` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_MODEL_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_REASONING_EFFORT` | Override-marks the configured model as supporting reasoning effort / thinking levels. |
| `model_capabilities.supports_vision_inputs` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_MODEL_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_VISION_INPUTS` | Marks the configured model as supporting multimodal image and PDF inputs. |

If both values stay `false`, Builder falls back to the built-in model capability registry.

### Provider Capability Overrides

Use these only for custom providers or models.

| Key | Type | Default | Env | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provider_capabilities.provider_id` | string | `""` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_PROVIDER_ID` | Required whenever you set provider capability overrides. |
| `provider_capabilities.supports_responses_api` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_RESPONSES_API` | Marks the provider as supporting the Responses API. |
| `provider_capabilities.supports_responses_compact` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_RESPONSES_COMPACT` | Marks the provider as supporting server-side compaction. |
| `provider_capabilities.supports_native_web_search` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_NATIVE_WEB_SEARCH` | Marks the provider as supporting native web search. |
| `provider_capabilities.supports_reasoning_encrypted` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_REASONING_ENCRYPTED` | Marks the provider as supporting encrypted reasoning items. |
| `provider_capabilities.supports_server_side_context_edit` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTS_SERVER_SIDE_CONTEXT_EDIT` | Marks the provider as supporting server-side context editing. |
| `provider_capabilities.is_openai_first_party` | bool | `false` | `BUILDER_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES_IS_OPENAI_FIRST_PARTY` | Marks the provider as first-party OpenAI semantics, which gates some Responses-specific behavior such as fast mode and phase protocol features. |

### Tools

`[tools]` is a per-tool boolean table in `config.toml`.
File-based tool toggles merge with defaults. `BUILDER_TOOLS` and `builder run --tools` behave differently: they replace the entire tool set with the CSV you provide.


| Key | Default | What enabling it exposes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools.ask_question` | `true` | Tool to ask interactive questions |
| `tools.shell` | `true` | The primary shell tool. Internally this maps to `exec_command`. |
| `tools.patch` | dynamic | Freeform patch grammar edit tool |
| `tools.edit` | dynamic | JSON text replacement/create/delete edit tool |
| `tools.trigger_handoff` | `false` | Experimental tool the agents can use to proactively compact their own context. |
| `tools.view_image` | `true` | Ability to view images and PDFs (if supported) |
| `tools.web_search` | `true` | Tool to search the web |
| `tools.write_stdin` | `true` | Interaction with background shells. |

Notes:

- `tools.web_search = true` does not force web search on. Native search still depends on `web_search = "native"` and provider support.
- `tools.patch` and `tools.edit` are mutually exclusive. If both are left at their defaults, Builder chooses `patch` for first-party OpenAI providers or `gpt-*` model names, and `edit` otherwise.
- To force `edit`, set `edit = true` and `patch = false`. To force `patch`, set `patch = true` and `edit = false`.

### Subagents

`[subagents.<role>]` is a file-only table for named headless subagent roles. Fast is always-present, but you can add custom agents here.
Subagent roles inherit the main config and then override only the keys set in that role table.
Set `system_prompt_file` inside a subagent role to use a role-specific main system prompt for `builder run --agent <role>`.

```toml
[subagents.fast]
model = "gpt-5.4-mini"
thinking_level = "low"

[subagents.fast.tools]
patch = false
```

More info on the [Subagents page](../headless.md).

### Skills

`[skills]` is a file-only per-skill boolean table in `config.toml` to disable unneeded skills. Keys are matched case-insensitively.


| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills.<skill name>` | `true` | Enables or disables a discovered skill for new sessions. Disabled skills are omitted from the injected skills developer message and shown as `disabled` in `/status`. |

Notes:

- Skill toggles are only applied when Builder creates a new conversation/session.
- Use `"quoted names"` to refer to skill keys containing spaces.
- Preinstalled skills are seeded into `~/.builder/.generated/skills`; disable them here instead of editing generated files.
