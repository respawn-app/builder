# Async Workflow Implementation Checklist

This checklist is the execution tracker for `docs/dev/async-workflow-orchestration.md`. Keep it updated while implementing. Mark items complete only after code, tests, and verification for that item are done.

Do not treat this as a replacement for the spec. If spec and checklist conflict, stop and update both before continuing.

## Working Rules

- [ ] Work one slice at a time, in order, unless Nikita explicitly changes priority.
- [ ] Use TDD for production behavior: write failing tests first, implement, refactor.
- [ ] Keep each slice buildable before moving to the next slice.
- [ ] Commit after each completed slice or stable sub-slice.
- [ ] Do not run real-provider workflow QA without explicit Nikita approval.
- [ ] Use fake model/runtime adapters for automated workflow runtime tests.
- [ ] Keep CLI as internal harness/agent surface, not Nikita's manual QA surface.
- [ ] Treat workflow API/read-model DTOs as mutable before Builder 2.0.
- [ ] Keep POC GUI integration behind a thin adapter layer.
- [ ] Never load full `events.jsonl` in workflow code or tests.
- [ ] Update `docs/dev/decisions.md` when a new locked product/architecture decision is made.
- [ ] When a slice changes a locked decision, update `docs/dev/decisions.md` first, then this checklist/spec.
- [ ] Avoid staging unrelated user changes; inspect `git status --short` before every commit.
- [ ] Use this checklist as the handoff contract during implementation; do not invent parallel task trackers.
- [ ] Mark checklist items incrementally while implementing so handoffs resume from exact state.

## Repo Path Assumptions

Checked before implementation in this worktree:

- `server/workflow` does not exist yet and is the intended pure domain package for Slice 1.
- `server/workflowview` and `server/workflowruntime` do not exist yet and are intended package additions in later slices.
- Existing metadata paths are `server/metadata/migrations`, `server/metadata/queries.sql`, `server/metadata/store.go`, and `server/metadata/sqlitegen`.
- Existing shared boundary paths are `shared/serverapi`, `shared/servicecontract`, and `shared/client`.
- Existing transport path is `server/transport`.
- Existing CLI command path is `cli/builder`.
- If these paths change before a later slice starts, update this section before coding that slice.

## Slice 1: Workflow Domain And Graph Validation

- [ ] Add test join waits until all expected branch identities arrive.
- [ ] Add test duplicate branch arrival is idempotently ignored or rejected.
- [ ] Add test missing branch keeps join waiting.
- [ ] Add test deterministic aggregate ordering by branch identity/source node.
- [ ] Add test joined aggregate binds into next node input.
- [ ] Add test terminal branch does not accidentally satisfy unrelated join.

### 12.2 Implementation

- [ ] Implement fan-out transition application.
- [ ] Persist parallel batch and branch edge identity on placements.
- [ ] Implement join readiness query.
- [ ] Implement deterministic aggregation format.
- [ ] Implement join auto-transition through outgoing transition group.
- [ ] Update board/task read models for multiple active placements.
- [ ] Update CLI/API output for branch placements.

### 12.3 Verification

- [ ] Run fan-out/join tests.
- [ ] Run `./scripts/test.sh ./server/workflow/... ./server/workflowview/... ./server/metadata/...`.
- [ ] Run `./scripts/build.sh --output ./bin/builder`.
- [ ] Commit slice with message like `feat: add workflow fanout joins`.

## Slice 13: Recovery, Observability, And Hardening

Goal: operationally usable workflow backend ready for GUI-driven QA.

### 13.1 Red Tests

- [ ] Add restart test for queued run.
- [ ] Add restart test for running run becoming interrupted.
- [ ] Add restart test for interrupted run staying interrupted.
- [ ] Add restart test for waiting-for-question.
- [ ] Add restart test for pending approval.
- [ ] Add test resume interrupted run continues same session/run/worktree.
- [ ] Add test cancel run/task path.
- [ ] Add test fail state with actionable error.
- [ ] Add test role drift at scheduling time.
- [ ] Add test role drift at resume time.
- [ ] Add test CLI/API surfaces stable error code.

### 13.2 Implementation

- [ ] Implement resume service and CLI.
- [ ] Implement cancel service and CLI.
- [ ] Implement fail/error state transitions.
- [ ] Add structured logs around scheduler claims.
- [ ] Add structured logs around run completion.
- [ ] Add structured logs around transition application.
- [ ] Add structured logs around validation blockers.
- [ ] Add structured logs around workflow runtime errors.
- [ ] Add role-drift validation at scheduling and resume.
- [ ] Update read models for interrupted/failed/canceled states.
- [ ] Update docs/dev decisions if new locked decisions emerged.

### 13.3 Verification

- [ ] Run full workflow package tests.
- [ ] Run `./scripts/test.sh ./server/workflow/... ./server/workflowruntime/... ./server/workflowview/... ./server/metadata/... ./cli/builder/...`.
- [ ] Run `./scripts/build.sh --output ./bin/builder`.
- [ ] Commit slice with message like `feat: harden workflow recovery`.

## GUI/POC Integration Checkpoints

These are coordination points for Nikita's parallel GUI POC. Backend API shapes remain mutable before Builder 2.0.

- [ ] After Slice 3, confirm POC GUI can use adapter to read board/task/detail data if useful.
- [ ] After Slice 4, provide internal CLI/API smoke commands for GUI adapter reference.
- [ ] After Slice 8, coordinate first end-to-end fake-runtime GUI smoke if GUI exists.
- [ ] Before real-provider QA, ask Nikita for explicit approval and expected spend.
- [ ] During GUI QA, capture UX/API friction as decisions or follow-up tasks, not undocumented drift.

## Final Pre-Release Verification

Run when all intended workflow slices for release are complete.

- [ ] Run full test suite through `./scripts/test.sh`.
- [ ] Run release build through `./scripts/build.sh --output ./bin/builder`.
- [ ] Run no-LLM coding-agent smoke check from fresh persistence root.
- [ ] Run GUI/POC fake-runtime smoke if available.
- [ ] Run real-provider smoke only if Nikita explicitly approves.
- [ ] Verify docs and decisions are up to date.
- [ ] Verify no unrelated user changes are staged.
- [ ] Verify task/workflow code never reads full `events.jsonl`.
- [ ] Verify all new business logic has tests.
