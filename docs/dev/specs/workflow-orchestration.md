# Workflow Orchestration Spec

## Purpose And Scope

- Workflow orchestration turns Builder from a manually driven terminal coding-agent harness into a project-scoped workflow orchestrator.
- Users define workflows made of nodes, transition groups, and edges.
- Tasks move through graph nodes, Kanban statuses, agent workers, review loops, joins, and terminal states.
- Backend/domain/persistence/runtime are primary. Frontend surfaces follow backend API/read-model needs.
- Workflow API/read-model shapes are mutable before Builder 2.0.
- CLI is an internal backend-testing and agent-control surface, not the primary user manual QA surface.
- Real-provider workflow QA requires explicit Nikita approval because it spends provider credits and can fail for provider/model reasons unrelated to orchestration correctness.

## Domain Model

- `Task` is the primary durable work item. Existing Builder sessions are execution artifacts under tasks.
- A task may accumulate many sessions through loops, branches, retries, and complex chains.
- Task creation creates a durable task at the workflow start node.
- Automation starts only through explicit task-start, which applies the start node's outgoing transition and requests automation for the first executable placement.
- Automation then runs through automatic nodes until terminal or blocked by question, approval/manual gate, error, capacity, interruption, cancellation, or validation.
- Task lifecycle state derives from node placements/runs plus task cancellation metadata, not from a separate task status enum.
- Node placement is workflow/Kanban state; active/interrupted/done conditions come from runs and terminal nodes.
- Terminal-node placements remain active sink placements. Board/read models infer done from an active placement whose node kind is terminal.
- Task cancellation records cancellation metadata, interrupts active runs, suppresses scheduling, and archives the task to terminal/Done for board visibility.

## Workflow Definitions

- Workflow definitions are globally reusable and linked to projects. Projects do not copy graph definitions.
- Workflow validation is project-contextual because subagent roles and workspace config differ by project.
- SQLite is authoritative for workflow definitions in v1. No stable graph file format/import/export is required in v1.
- V1 workflow definitions may be created/edited through backend API plus minimal CLI.
- Workflow definitions may be saved, linked, and made project default while semantic validation fails.
- Draft saving still enforces storage invariants: valid IDs, valid references, valid enum values, unique keys, and exactly one start node.
- Backlog task creation can persist tasks for an invalid linked/default workflow so users can collect work while fixing the graph. Task start and runtime scheduling require project-context validation and reject invalid workflows with accumulated safe actionable errors.
- A project can link multiple workflows and has one default workflow for task creation.
- Invalid default workflows are allowed. Task creation against an invalid default creates Backlog tasks, while starting/running those tasks fails with accumulated validation errors until the workflow is fixed.
- Workflow creation auto-creates ordinary editable `backlog` and `done` nodes.
- Workflows carry a monotonic `version` over persisted definition changes. This is traceability/stale-warning data, not immutable graph versioning.
- Metadata-only changes and graph changes each increment workflow `version` once; combined metadata+graph saves also increment it once; no-op saves increment neither.
- Tasks, runs, transitions, approvals, and edge snapshots store observed workflow version where historical traceability is required.
- Run-start snapshots and transition/approval/fan-out edge snapshots keep using their snapshot. Anything not snapshotted uses current workflow graph/config at execution time.

## Nodes, Edges, And Validation

- Nodes configure agent runs: subagent role, prompt/template, output schema, limits, stop conditions, and worktree/session execution policy.
- Edges configure transitions: target node, approval/manual interaction, context preservation, context source, input bindings, output requirements, routing, and join/aggregation behavior.
- Subagent role is the executable node assignee. There is no separate assignee field.
- Workflow nodes select existing subagent roles only. There are no per-node model/provider/tool/auth overrides.
- Visible executable/terminal node identity is Kanban column/status identity. Join nodes are internal merge plumbing omitted from board read models.
- Workflows can contain start, agent, join, and terminal nodes. Approval is an edge property, not a manual-node requirement.
- V1 has exactly one start node. The start node is non-executable and has no inputs.
- For task creation/automation, the start node must have exactly one outgoing transition group containing exactly one edge targeting an agent node.
- Terminal nodes are strict sinks. Manual reopen/rework is a user override execution, not a durable graph transition.
- Draft validation reports semantic errors but does not block save/link/default selection.
- Task creation and execution validation accumulate all safe actionable errors and reject invalid graph/role/input configurations.
- Execution-valid graphs reject detached islands: every node reachable from start, every non-terminal can reach terminal, terminal cannot auto-run.
- Cycles/self-loops are allowed outside restricted fan-out branch paths.
- Graph identity uses opaque server-generated primary keys plus stable human/model-facing keys.
- `node_key`, `transition_id`, `edge_key`, output field names, and binding names match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`.
- Workflow display names are labels, not references, and are trimmed non-empty strings capped at 120 chars.

## Completion Runtime

- Agent nodes complete by producing structured workflow completion, not by returning natural language.
- Completion chooses an outgoing transition group and supplies derived provision field values required by downstream consuming nodes.
- Runtime failure, cancellation, unanswered questions, and validation blockers are orchestration outcomes, not model-selected terminal statuses.
- Completion modes are `structured_output` and dynamic `complete_node` tool. Global `[workflow].completion_mode` selects `auto`, `structured_output`, or `tool`; there is no workflow/node override.
- `auto` uses structured output when provider capabilities support it and dynamic tool mode otherwise.
- Forced `structured_output` fails fast with an actionable error when unsupported. Forced `tool` always uses dynamic tool mode.
- `complete_node` is workflow-control infrastructure and is available in tool completion mode regardless of subagent role tool config.
- Normal assistant final answers are invalid in workflow mode. Runtime appends a nudge and continues until valid completion, `ask_question`, interruption, cancellation, protocol cap, or runtime error.
- Completion schema exposes only `transition_id`, optional `commentary`, and server-derived possible provision fields as top-level properties. It never exposes raw `next_node`.
- Provision fields are flat and string-only. Arrays, nested objects, and mixed scalar types are out of scope for v1.
- Possible provision fields are optional in the generated schema. Selected transition groups impose required provision fields after `transition_id` is known.
- Required provision fields must be present as trimmed non-empty strings.
- Size limits: output field name `<= 64` chars, output field description `<= 1000`, output value `<= 64 KiB`, commentary `<= 64 KiB`, task comment body `<= 256 KiB`.
- Dynamic schemas can affect prompt-cache continuity if workflow config changes mid-run; this is acceptable.
- Runtime enforces protocol caps. Repeated final answers or invalid completion attempts interrupt the run after `[workflow].max_final_answer_violations = 3` or `[workflow].max_invalid_completion_attempts = 5`.
- No wall-clock runtime cap is required for v1.

## Workflow Prompting

- Workflow runs use dedicated workflow-mode developer instructions.
- Prompt explains task identity, node role/assignee, completion behavior, question behavior, handoff/transition mechanics, task comments, and why ordinary final answers are invalid.
- Workflow runtime builds on reusable headless/session infrastructure for session launch, runtime wiring, logging, progress, subagent role handling, and mode prompts.
- `RunPromptService.RunPrompt` final text is not workflow completion authority.
- Existing user goal state is not reused as workflow autonomy state.
- Task comments are not automatically injected into agent context. Agents read comments through CLI/API when needed.

## Questions And Approvals

- User questions use existing `ask_question` tool-call/session infrastructure.
- A model does not report `needs_user_input` as a completion status; it calls `ask_question`.
- The run pauses until answered.
- V1 must not introduce a shadow task-question table. If existing ask persistence cannot support workflow asks, upgrade ask persistence as source of truth.
- Ask rehydration must be proven before scheduler recovery depends on it.
- Scheduler uses a boundary such as `PendingAskResolver.CanRehydrate(sessionID, runID, askID)`.
- If pending ask cannot rehydrate, workflow run becomes interrupted with actionable resume path.
- Edge approval is a boolean edge property.
- When any edge in a selected transition group requires approval, the whole group waits for one approval before any target placement/run starts.
- Pending approvals store resolved transition group, edge set, workflow version, source node snapshot, transition display snapshot, target node snapshots, and effective edge config snapshots.
- Later graph edits do not change what a user approves.
- Every applied transition stores transition-edge snapshot rows, not only pending approvals.

## Context Preservation And Bindings

- Per-edge context preservation supports `new_session`, `continue_session`, and `compact_and_continue_session`.
- Continuation modes may select `immediate_source` or `node:<node_key>` as context source.
- Direct `continue_session` may continue only when target node uses the same subagent role name as source session.
- Same-role config drift does not block continuation; persisted session setup remains authoritative for snapshotted model/provider/tool/system-prompt fields.
- `new_session` and `compact_and_continue_session` use current role config at their fresh context boundary.
- Consuming agent nodes own required inputs as named top-level string fields with descriptions.
- Prompt placeholders validate against the consuming node's required inputs through `.Inputs.<name>`.
- Prompt templates may reference guaranteed-prior agent node outputs through `.Nodes.<node_key>.<output_name>`.
- `.Nodes` references use stable node keys and declared source-node output fields. The referenced source node must dominate the consuming node in the workflow graph, the source node must not be the consuming node, and unsupported dynamic template access to `.Inputs` or `.Nodes` is invalid.
- Runtime freezes `.Nodes` values when the consuming run or approval edge is created. Prompt rendering uses the frozen values and does not re-resolve prior runs.
- The first executable node reached from `start` cannot declare upstream inputs and should use task fields such as `.TaskTitle` and `.TaskBody`.
- Source-node output fields declare reusable outputs that later prompts can reference through `.Nodes.<node_key>.<output_name>`.
- Edge input bindings and edge output requirements are not canonical workflow-editing concepts.
- The server derives provision fields, same-name input bindings, selected-transition output requirements, and possible completion fields from node required inputs, prompt node-output references, graph topology, and join provider selections.

## Parallelism And Joins

- Transition groups model fan-out. Multiple edges in one group create parallel branch placements/runs.
- Branches are ordinary workflow nodes, not subtasks.
- GUI-authored node groups are saved only as execution-shaped parallel groups. A node group contains branch nodes and one join; the fan-out remains canonical workflow graph structure through one transition group with multiple edges.
- A task may have multiple active placements/runs only when the graph explicitly fans out.
- Parallel joins always wait for all required inputs in v1. Racing/first-success semantics are out of scope.
- Fan-out topology must have exactly one unambiguous nearest common join reachable from every branch.
- Branch paths before that join may not terminate, enter nested fan-out, or contain cycles.
- Ambiguous/complex fan-out is rejected in v1.
- Fan-out join readiness uses persisted transition-edge snapshot rows from accepted source transition as expected edge set.
- Later graph edits do not change an in-flight parallel batch's wait set.
- Join nodes are non-agent fan-in points that aggregate inbound output values into deterministic results then follow their outgoing transition group.
- Agent synthesis belongs in a normal agent node after the join.
- Orchestrator-workers do not dynamically create workflow nodes or Kanban columns in v1.

## Scheduler And Recovery

- Scheduler has durable inputs in SQLite, but pending scheduler work and active runtime ownership are live memory, not durable run states.
- Runnable work derives from active executable placements with approved automation intent, no terminal run outcome, and no task cancellation.
- Pending-work ordering is scheduler memory.
- Active execution derives from live runtime registry/scheduler ownership.
- Concurrency limit is global only and configured in `[workflow].concurrency`.
- Scheduler does not own runtime leases. Runtime leases remain execution-control state, not scheduling authority.
- Startup rebuilds runnable work from durable state.
- Completed runs and pending approvals remain as-is.
- Waiting-for-question remains only if the pending ask can rehydrate.
- Started runs with no terminal outcome and no live owner after startup become interrupted with restart/shutdown reason.
- Interrupted runs are never automatically retried.
- Explicit resume continues the interrupted session/run from current transcript/worktree state.
- Completion/transition application uses a fence/generation or compare-and-swap so stale runtime callbacks cannot mutate superseded runs.
- Run completion and transition application remain one SQLite transaction.
- Runtime failures, cancellation, crashes, model/runtime interruptions, and fixable scheduling validation blockers converge on interrupted outcome with reason metadata.
- `failed` is reserved for unrecoverable corrupted orchestration state.

## Worktrees

- A task owns one managed worktree by default.
- All executable agent nodes require and reuse the task managed worktree.
- Builder creates the managed worktree on task start before first executable run is scheduled.
- Task worktree branch name is the task short ID.
- Worktree creation reuses existing worktree branch/root collision handling.
- Worktree deletion/retargeting treats non-terminal tasks referencing a managed worktree as blockers.
- Workflow worktree creation uses lower-level primitives and does not require an interactive session controller lease.

## Project Keys And Task IDs

- Project keys are uppercase, globally unique within a persistence root, 2-8 chars, and match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,7}$`.
- Project creation chooses a key explicitly; default suggestion can use the first three letters of project name.
- Existing projects without a key get one from default project-name logic when task support initializes, with collision handling.
- Project keys are immutable after a project has tasks.
- Existing task short IDs keep their historical key forever.
- Task short IDs are stored durable product identifiers, not derived display strings.
- Task required fields are title, short ID, and body.
- Task metadata is designed for import/export and may include `source_url`.

## Comments

- Agents may add, replace, and delete task comments through CLI/API task management.
- There are no model-callable comment tools.
- Comments record author/source agent when available.
- Comments stay in Builder persistence, not files in the worktree.
- Task comments are hard-deleted task-local notes.
- Comment rows do not store source-run links, deleted tombstones, or opaque metadata.
- Include-deleted comment APIs and read-model state are not product scope.

## Persistence And Schema

- Use SQLite for structured workflow/task state. Keep transcripts and large session artifacts file-backed.
- Workflow implementation package boundaries are locked:
- `server/workflow`: pure domain types, validation, state-machine logic.
- `server/workflowstore`: metadata persistence adapter.
- `server/workflowsvc`: use-case/service orchestration.
- `server/workflowscheduler`: runnable derivation and workers.
- `server/workflowruntime`: completion/runtime contracts used by runtime.
- `server/workflowrunner`: session/runtime/headless adapter for scheduling.
- `server/workflowview`: read models.
- Start node is derived from `workflow_nodes.kind = 'start'` and enforced with a partial unique index; do not store `workflows.start_node_id`.
- Workflow graph storage derives membership from relationships instead of duplicate workflow IDs where practical.
- Workflow definitions do not persist opaque `metadata_json` on workflows, nodes, node groups, transition groups, or edges.
- Project workflow links are active membership rows only. Do not soft-unlink.
- Unlink hard-deletes unused links. If tasks exist, user must move/delete tasks before unlinking.
- Blocked unlink returns typed blockers with counts/references.
- Retiring a workflow means deleting the workflow definition and cascading/deleting tasks through explicit workflow deletion.
- `tasks.project_workflow_link_id` is the source of truth for task project/workflow pairing.
- Direct duplicated `tasks.project_id` and `tasks.workflow_id` columns are removed with a hard cutover.
- Project default pointers use `projects.default_project_workflow_link_id` and `projects.primary_workspace_id`, each constrained to rows owned by the same project.
- Workspace/worktree labels, availability, primary/default status, and main-worktree status are read-model facts derived from canonical roots/pointers.
- Runtime leases persist durable controller-token facts only: `id`, `session_id`, and `created_at_unix_ms`.
- Workflow invalidation events are process-local live signals, not durable/replayable sequence state. SQLite does not store `workflow_events`.
- GUI clients refetch read models after subscription ACK/reconnect/error and treat live events as invalidation hints.
- There is no product archive lifecycle for workflows or nodes.
- Workflow deletion impact previews return counts only.
- Confirmed workflow deletion removes DB workflow-linked tasks, links, and graph rows; it blocks active/runnable runs and default-without-replacement states.
- Workflow deletion is DB-only by default and preserves artifacts/worktrees. Artifact cleanup is an explicit future opt-in path.
- Batch graph save uses a store-owned transaction with expected workflow `version`, draft validation, process-local edit semantics, typed blockers, and confirmation for unreferenced graph row removals.
- Graph saves never delete or move tasks; whole-workflow deletion is the task-deleting path.

## Schema Minimization Decisions

- Approved cutover removals include `workflow_events`, `project_workflow_links.unlinked_at_unix_ms`, duplicated task project/workflow columns, workflow graph opaque metadata, `runtime_leases.request_id`, workspace/worktree display labels, `task_comments.source_run_id`, comment soft-delete, and redundant indexes when equivalent unique/leading-key indexes remain.
- Keep `tasks.source_url` as a structured task field.
- Keep `tasks.short_id` as stored durable product data.
- Task sequence allocation is transactional behavior, not product state stored as `projects.next_task_seq`.
- Runtime context/source-run hints belong in typed relations or derivation, not `task_runs.metadata_json`.
- Observed run workflow version derives from run-start snapshots; `task_runs.workflow_revision_seen` is not the long-term authority.
- Keep `task_comments.author_id`; future multi-agent/user identity display depends on it.
- Run-start snapshots are the long-term historical display/config authority, not transition-edge display/config snapshot columns.
- Keep `sessions.first_prompt_preview` as stored listing/read-model data.
- Keep `sessions.input_draft` as stored unsent prompt recovery data.

## CLI Surface

- Minimal workflow/task CLI exists to exercise backend behavior and teach agents task usage.
- CLI output must include stable IDs needed by later commands.
- Machine-readable `--json` output and workflow-specific environment variables are not required in the first CLI milestone.
- Unsupported commands may fail loudly before backend semantics land rather than implementing partial behavior.

## Q/A Decisions Preserved

- Q: Should workflow definitions use a stable graph file format in v1? A: No; SQLite/API/CLI are authoritative for v1.
- Q: Is task creation the same as starting automation? A: No; creation makes a backlog task, and task-start is explicit.
- Q: Is completion mode per workflow/node? A: No; it is a temporary global config.
- Q: Should workflow runs have a wall-clock cap? A: No v1 wall-clock cap.
- Q: Should v1 auto-retry interrupted/runtime-failed runs? A: No; human resume is required.
- Q: Are racing/first-success parallel branches in scope? A: No; joins wait for all required inputs.
- Q: Can orchestrator-workers dynamically create workflow nodes/columns? A: No in v1.
- Q: Should pending workflow questions get a task-question shadow table? A: No; use `ask_question` source of truth or upgrade ask persistence.
- Q: Does real-provider workflow QA need explicit approval? A: Yes, ask Nikita before spending provider credits.
- Q: Does the first CLI milestone need JSON output or workflow env vars? A: No.
- Q: Should `tasks.short_id` be stored or derived from `project_key + task_seq`? A: Keep it stored as durable product data.
- Q: Should `projects.next_task_seq` stay stored? A: No; replace it with transactional task sequence allocation.
- Q: Should `task_runs.metadata_json` stay? A: No; remove it as one of the next schema cleanup tasks.
- Q: Should `task_runs.workflow_revision_seen` stay stored? A: No; derive it from run-start snapshots after migration.
- Q: Should `task_comments.author_id` stay? A: Yes; keep it for future identity display.
- Q: Should transition-edge display/config snapshots stay? A: No; remove them after run-start snapshots are the sole historical display/config source.
- Q: Should `sessions.first_prompt_preview` stay stored? A: Yes.
- Q: Should `sessions.input_draft` stay stored? A: Yes.
