# Core Runtime And Tools Spec

## Product Scope

- Kent is a minimal professional coding agent focused on output quality, speed, long-running work, and transparent activity.
- Architecture stays composable and pluggable with low-friction extension points.
- Source layout authority is `cli/*` for CLI/frontend packages, `server/*` for authoritative runtime/persistence/tool/auth/workflow logic, and `shared/*` for boundary-safe DTOs/contracts.
- Full-access execution is the v1 default; there is no default sandbox.
- The working CLI name is `kent` and should remain easy to rename.
- Public docs use Astro + Starlight from `docs/`, deploy as static GitHub Pages, mirror root `README.md` as initial home, and use Algolia DocSearch.

## Client/Server Boundary

- Server owns durable lifecycle state, lifecycle mutations, and canonical lifecycle event streams.
- CLI/TUI consumes client-facing DTOs and shared service clients. It does not own alternate durable/runtime lifecycle flows for embedded-local mode.
- Embedded-local mode adapts through the same loopback service/client boundary as remote/shared-server mode. Direct in-process engine, broker, process, auth, or project objects may exist only behind server-owned adapters.
- `shared/clientui` is a DTO/read-model boundary only. Runtime-event state transitions, pending-input policy, reasoning-stream presentation, activity transitions, transcript-sync commands, background notices, and prompt-history commands are owned by CLI packages.
- `shared/serverapi` is a wire-contract package only: serializable request/response DTOs, validation helpers, typed wire errors, stream/progress DTOs, and route-facing value contracts.
- Server-owned service interfaces, concrete service implementations, runtime handles, headless launchers, logging/timeout policy, lifecycle orchestration, and close/drop semantics must not live in `shared/serverapi`.
- In-process route service interfaces live in `shared/servicecontract`. That package is the narrow loopback boundary for shared clients/server adapters and contains route-shaped interfaces with no execution policy.
- CLI production packages must not import `server/*` directly except documented composition bridge packages.
- User-visible lifecycle side effects trigger at one client-facing accepted-event boundary, not inside only one transport/runtime path.
- Incomplete migration paths should be removed instead of preserved as compatibility shims. Breaking API/protocol changes are acceptable when documented and surfaced clearly.

## Skills And Generated Assets

- Skills are discovered from Kent-owned roots: `~/.kent/skills`, workspace `.kent/skills`, and generated embedded skills under `~/.kent/.generated/skills`.
- First-run onboarding may optionally symlink skills and slash-command roots from supported source tools into Kent's layout; runtime discovery still reads only Kent-owned directories.
- `config.toml` supports file-only `[skills]` boolean toggles for per-skill new-session enable/disable. Disabled skills remain visible in `/status` and only affect future skills-message injection.
- Preinstalled skills are seeded from binary-embedded deterministic assets under `prompts/skills/**` into `~/.kent/.generated/skills`.
- `~/.kent/.generated` is deterministic, destructible, overwritten on server startup, and not user-owned.
- Generated sync runs on server startup (`kent serve` or embedded server), not in clients.
- Generated asset integrity uses `.generated/.kent-generated.json` with schema, Kent version, and tree hash excluding the marker.
- Edited/add/delete/rename/symlink/invalid-marker generated trees move to `~/.kent/recovered/<UTC timestamp>/.generated`, then regenerate.
- If `~/.kent/recovered` is non-empty, every new session gets a user-facing, non-model-visible warning asking the user to clean recovered files and not edit `.generated`.
- Generated skills are always seeded. Existing `[skills]` toggles only disable injection by normalized skill name.
- User skills with the same normalized name shadow generated skills.
- Initial preinstalled skill framework ships `skill-creator`; generated skill validation rejects empty files, invalid frontmatter, duplicate generated names, and symlinks/non-regular entries.

## Core Tools

- Core tools are `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `view_image`, `patch`, and `ask_question`.
- Experimental agent-only `trigger_handoff` is config-gated under `[tools]`, defaults to `false`, and is always declared for a session when enabled instead of dynamically shown/hidden.
- Goal management is CLI/runtime-owned. Kent must not add model-callable goal tools.

## Runtime Output Boundary

- Runtime owns one active conversation list/stateflow per session runtime.
- Runtime producers materialize conversation-facing output through `steer`.
- Runtime producers store delayed conversation-facing output through `queue`; queues store typed steering intents and flush through `steer`.
- A steering intent may contain one item or an ordered pack of items. Item order inside the pack is preserved.
- Steering items cover model-visible messages, runtime context, reminders, tool completions, local transcript entries, streaming/progress projection updates, and runtime status events.
- Ordering, transcript visibility, ongoing/detail presentation, model visibility, dedupe, derived events, and post-persist state updates are steering policy, not separate append paths.
- Queued user text may coalesce at flush into one user message separated by blank lines; the coalesced message is a normal steering intent.
- Runtime events that do not create model-history items still route through the output boundary.
- History replacement is an output mutation owned by the same boundary. Normal additions after replacement use `steer`.

## Command Execution

- `exec_command` is the only shell-command execution surface. The legacy `shell` tool is removed from future design decisions.
- Commands run in the user login shell, non-TTY mode, with direct shell invocation and no runtime command parsing or AST preprocessing.
- Execution inherits parent environment and adds non-interactive hints.
- stdout/stderr merge into one stream without origin tags.
- Command lifetime is unlimited. `yield_time_ms` controls when Kent returns control and backgrounds the process.
- Non-zero exit is recoverable and does not auto-abort the turn.
- Shell process-launch failures are not automatically retried.
- Interrupt escalation is `SIGINT` then `SIGKILL` after 10 seconds.
- Command post-processing is Kent-owned, applied after execution, configured under `[shell]`, and bypassed by per-call `raw=true`.
- `[shell].postprocessing_mode` uses `none | builtin | user | all`.
- The generic sanitizer runs before built-ins and hooks for every non-raw mode except `none`.
- Built-ins run before the optional user hook. A built-in halt stops later built-ins only.
- User hooks receive JSON stdin and return JSON stdout, receiving both original sanitized output and Kent's current processed output.
- Hook failures do not change the provider-facing command-output envelope in v1.
- Background shell processes are app-global. Process IDs are app-global within one app instance; owner session metadata is advisory for routing notices/history, not access control.
- `/ps` may surface and operate on background processes from other sessions in the same app instance.

## Patch And Image Tools

- `patch` apply is atomic: malformed/conflicting patches make no file changes.
- `patch` supports add, update, move, and delete.
- Patch targets are validated with real-path resolution.
- `patch` has no timeout and no automatic retries.
- Patch success persistence includes patch input plus apply-result metadata.
- Outside-workspace edits are approval-gated unless explicitly enabled. `allow_non_cwd_edits=false` by default.
- If outside-workspace approval is denied, Kent returns an explicit non-circumvention tool error instructing manual user edits when essential.
- `view_image` path resolution uses absolute and canonical real paths before access checks.
- Workspace boundary checks apply after symlink resolution; symlink escapes are blocked by default.
- Outside-workspace file reads are approval-gated through the same approver contract as `patch`.
- Approved outside-workspace reads are written to run logs with requested/resolved path metadata.
- Default `view_image` raster attachment materialization optimizes performance and minimizes provider-bound data transfer by validating then attempting to re-encode every supported non-raw raster image with source bytes `>= 100 KiB` into JPEG. If JPEG optimization fails or does not reduce payload size, Kent preserves the original validated image bytes and enforces the attachment size cap.
- WebP input and WebP transcoding are disabled while Kent lacks a reliable maintained WebP encoder. Re-enabling WebP requires a provider-compatible encoder and regression coverage against issue #308's invalid compressed-alpha output.

## Tool Output And Failures

- Large tool output is truncated for model consumption using standardized head/tail payloads with truncation metadata.
- Model-step transient failures use exponential backoff retries with 5 attempts: `1s`, `2s`, `4s`, `8s`, `16s`.
- Model/API errors in ongoing mode are shown as concise single-line errors; full details remain in detail/logs.
- Persisted operator-facing turn-start failures that prevent the agent loop from starting use `developer_error_feedback` so they appear in ongoing scrollback.
- Local command/validation failures that do not block a model turn remain plain `error` diagnostics.

## Ask Question

- `ask_question` is shared by model and runtime with unified UI.
- Runtime `ask_question` pauses the active pipeline until answered.
- Questions wait indefinitely; there is no timeout/default cancel.
- Model-callable `ask_question` is limited to ordinary question/suggestion/freeform asks. Approval prompts are internal automated workflows and are not exposed to the model tool schema.
- Suggestions support a freeform override branch. `Tab` toggles between picker and freeform commentary editing.
- Suggestions use schema-level 1-based `recommended_option_index` instead of encoding recommendations into suggestion text.
- Recommended suggestion UI shows a green marker and faint recommended note; selected recommended row uses selected-row styling.
- Selecting freeform with empty input opens freeform editing; submitting from that path still requires non-empty commentary.
- Returning to picker preserves a pending freeform draft as muted text.
- Internal approval asks show only `Allow once`, `Allow for this session`, and `Deny`.
- Internal approval commentary is injected through regular queued user-message steering; denial fails the guarded tool call authoritatively.
- Freeform ask input uses the same editor/cursor behavior as main input.
- Source origin is not labeled in UI.
- Answers are persisted as explicit summary text including selected option number and commentary.
- Ask queue semantics are strict FIFO, in-memory only, and submitted answers are not editable.
- Optional post-answer action binding uses typed registry with stable ID, payload schema, and handler.
- v1 ships registry scaffolding only. Action payload schemas are unversioned in v1. Unknown action ID is fatal.

## Sessions And Persistence

- Sessions support stop/resume.
- Persistence root is configurable; default is `~/.kent`.
- Durable domain model is `project > workspace > worktree`.
- SQLite is authoritative for structured metadata and server-owned resources.
- Large append-only session artifacts remain file-backed under `projects/<project-id>/sessions/<session-id>`.
- Sessions are project-scoped durable objects and carry mutable current execution target `(workspace_id, worktree_id?, cwd_relpath)`.
- App-global daemon listen config is explicit through `server_host` and `server_port`. Kent binds exactly the configured address and fails startup if occupied.
- Same-machine Unix-socket optimization is local-first and additive. Explicit `server_host` or `server_port` overrides stay authoritative.
- JSON-RPC custom error codes in `shared/protocol` are wire contracts. `ErrCodeRequestCanceled` maps to `context.Canceled`.
- Interactive startup is workspace-first. Unregistered cwd enters an explicit post-auth binding flow with create-new-project first and existing-project picker below.
- Server-browsing mode can open existing server projects/workspaces only; it must not offer binding or project creation for the client path.
- Headless startup in an unregistered workspace fails fast; it must not auto-create hidden project/workspace state.
- To recover from headless fail-fast workspace binding, `kent project [path]` inspects the project bound to a path, `kent attach [path]` binds a workspace to the project already bound to cwd, and `kent attach --project <project-id> [path]` binds with an explicit project override. All forms default `path` to cwd.
- Minimum server-admin setup commands are `kent project list`, `kent project create --path <server-path> --name <project-name>`, and `kent attach --project <project-id> <server-path>`.
- Server-admin project/binding commands prefer RPC to the configured running daemon when available; they must not require shutting down the server or taking local ownership of the persistence root.
- Explicit relocation recovery is `kent rebind <session-id> <new-path>`, which retargets one session to a different workspace root.
- When a session selected from the interactive picker has a stored workspace root different from Kent's current workspace root, startup shows `Workspace changed`. `Yes` retargets that session before opening; `No` returns to the session picker.
- Workspace relocation/rebinding is explicit user action; Kent does not infer auto-rebinds.
- Session metadata authority lives in SQLite. `session.json` is removed from authoritative layout.
- Interactive session creation is lazily durable.
- Session start/setup becomes immutable at first model request dispatch, except thinking level can change on resume.
- Lock covers model, core generation params, enabled tools, tool schema/description snapshot, and system prompt snapshot.
- Transcript message order is immutable for cache stability.
- Canonical model context/history is stored as Responses API input items; message-only chat is UI projection.
- `events.jsonl` is append-only on normal writes; periodic compaction rewrites canonical JSONL to control growth.
- Full transcript history can be gigabytes. Production code must not load full `events.jsonl` into memory.
- Crash-loss tolerance allows losing up to one in-flight tool call. No session event compression.

## Auth

- OpenAI auth supports API key and subscription OAuth.
- Auth is global app-level, not per-session.
- Startup blocks on auth only when the resolved provider path requires Kent-managed OpenAI auth.
- Explicit OpenAI-compatible base URLs and other non-OpenAI provider paths may continue without Kent-managed auth.
- Startup auth failures and 401s surface as normal actionable UX.
- Startup auth picker uses themed startup picker style and friendly titles with one-line explanations.
- Picker exposes browser OAuth, device-code OAuth, `No auth`, and env-key adoption when available.
- Browser OAuth uses a hybrid callback flow accepting local callback or pasted callback URL/code.
- OAuth issuer routing is not configurable in production. `KENT_OAUTH_ISSUER` is intentionally unsupported.
- Interactive startup treats `OPENAI_API_KEY` as chooser-backed auth source, not unconditional override.
- Saved subscription auth plus env key with no preference asks the user which source should win.
- `/login` and `/logout` reopen auth selection without clearing credentials first. Only choosing `No auth` clears active auth method and env-vs-saved preference.
- OAuth failure does not auto-fallback to API key.
- OAuth refresh is silent except refresh failures are surfaced.
- Global auth method can be switched only while idle.
- Auth credentials are plain JSON under the persistence root with restrictive file permissions; no OS secure-store backend exists in v1.

## Configuration

- User settings load from `~/.kent/config.toml`.
- Unknown config keys are errors.
- Precedence is CLI overrides > environment > settings file > built-in defaults.
- After first successful auth, missing `config.toml` triggers first-time setup before session selection.
- Headless startup writes default config directly with `theme = "auto"`.
- `theme=light` and `theme=dark` select fixed Kent palettes. `theme=auto` or omitted theme uses terminal background detection.
- Global debug mode is configured by `debug = true` or `KENT_DEBUG=1` and enables developer-oriented strictness.
- Thinking level applies only to OpenAI model families and passes configured values through unchanged.
- Context window setting is `model_context_window`, default `272000`.
- `context_compaction_threshold_tokens < model_context_window` is required.
- Responses API `store` is configurable with default `false`.
- `tools.web_search` is enabled by default; `web_search` selects provider-native search (`native`) or disabled (`off`).
- `tools.view_image` is enabled by default and advertised only to multimodal-capable models.

## Compaction

- Auto-compaction is enabled near context limits.
- Compaction starts a new active conversation list from compacting output seed items. Full persisted session events remain in the durable session log.
- Runtime context needed after compaction, including workflow prompts and reminders, is steered into the new active list after replacement.
- Kent may compact before submitting a queued user prompt when current context usage is within the runway reserve.
- Pre-submit compaction uses `context_compaction_threshold_tokens - pre_submit_compaction_lead_tokens`, with default lead `35000`.
- Startup rejects compaction settings that begin normal or pre-submit compaction below 50% of `model_context_window`.
- Auto-compaction failure aborts the current turn.
- `compaction_mode=none` disables manual and automatic compaction.
- Manual `/compact` is available while idle; arguments are appended as guidance.
- Human-facing UX says `compact`; agent-facing prompt/tool language says `handoff`.
- Successful manual `/compact` steers a hidden developer carryover message containing the last visible user prompt.
- Agent-triggered handoff uses its own internal compaction mode and may steer a detail-only future-agent developer message; it does not reuse manual carryover semantics.
- Main-agent OpenAI `session_id` remains the persisted Kent session ID for the conversation lifetime.
- Prompt-cache lineage rotates by compaction generation: base `<session_id>`, then `<session_id>/compact-N`.
- Supervisor/reviewer cache lineage uses `<session_id>/supervisor` with the same compaction generation counter.
- Local compaction instructions are final `developer` messages. Runtime rejects any tool calls returned by local compaction.
- Local compaction summary generation reuses the normal main-agent request envelope and changes only request items by appending compaction instructions.
- If native or local compaction exceeds provider context length, Kent retries by collapsing supported historical tool payloads in the compaction request only. The four total attempts are the original request, then cumulative collapse targets of 10%, 20%, and 40% of the model context window. Shell outputs, including `exec_command` and `write_stdin` outputs, and patch inputs collapse to exact text `<collapsed>`; tool calls and call/output relationships remain present. Reasoning items and unsupported tool payloads are not removed or collapsed. Successful repaired compaction persists an operator-visible diagnostic with collapse counts and estimated omitted tokens.
- Compaction lifecycle status is emitted through runtime output mutation. Durable replacement uses the `history_replaced` session event.
- Completed compaction creates no UI-only transcript row. Transcript-visible compaction summaries come from server-owned transcript items.

## Model Defaults

- Model seed is unset by default.
- Temperature is fixed to `1`.
- Max output tokens are unlimited by default.

## Goals

- Kent CLI is the authoritative control surface for goals.
- Models may use normal shell commands `kent goal show`, `kent goal complete`, and first-time `kent goal set <objective>` for the current session.
- Agent `goal set` is allowed only when no active or paused goal exists. Completed goals do not block the next agent-set goal.
- `/goal <objective>` immediately sets/replaces the session goal and starts a model turn. It is rejected while a model turn is running.
- `/goal resume` on a completed goal reopens it as active.
- Goal completion is explicit CLI state mutation, not natural-language inference.
- Goal mode requires `ask_question` for active model loops. Validate parity at model-work startup and surface normal runtime error if violated.
- Goal CLI never mutates session DB directly. It crosses live server/runtime RPC.
- Standalone `kent goal` commands do not acquire controller leases; model-shell CLI has narrow lease-free authority for same-session show, first-time set, and confirm-gated complete.
- While a model turn runs, TUI goal lifecycle accepts only pause and clear.
- Ctrl+C during active goal work keeps persisted status `active` and creates runtime-local suspension only.
- Goal prompts and model-facing goal error copy live under `prompts/goal/`.

## Headless Mode

- `kent run "prompt"` is the supported headless/subagent interface.
- Headless roles use `kent run --agent <role> "prompt"`; `--fast` selects the built-in fast role.
- Subagent roles are file-only `[subagents.<role>]` config tables and inherit main config unless overridden.
- Subagent roles may set `agent_callable=false`; such roles are hidden from agent-facing role context and rejected for Kent-session subagent calls, while humans may still run them from ordinary shells.
- Future frontend/status surfaces should mark non-callable roles distinctly when relevant instead of erasing the distinction.
- The built-in `fast` role exists without config and may switch to a smaller/faster profile on exact OpenAI first-party setups.
- Headless executes a single non-interactive prompt with normal runtime/session persistence.
- It creates/resumes normal sessions and auto-names unnamed sessions `<session-id> subagent`.
- Default timeout is infinite; `--timeout` can bound execution.
- Output modes are explicit: `final-text` default and optional `json`.
- JSON mode emits exactly one final object on stdout.
- Progress is quiet by default and emits to stderr only with `--progress-mode=stderr`.
- A headless run owns the active session runtime it registers. Interactive activation for the same active session attaches read-only.
- Resuming a session with persisted subagent role metadata reapplies that role best-effort when it exists. Missing roles do not block explicit continuation.

## Provider Wiring

- OpenAI requests always set `originator` and `User-Agent`.
- `session_id` header is sent whenever a session ID exists, for both OAuth and API-key auth.
- LLM provider wiring uses a provider-factory seam so runtime/app constructs clients via provider selection.
